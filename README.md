# Bouy-spectra-resotring-demo

The project contain demonstration of the algorithm of ocean
wave spectrum estimation by acceleration data from particle
on the ocean surface.

To simplify task the demo is limited by the one dimensional case.

## Demo scripts

Some demonstration scripts with graphs are located in the
folder `demo`:

- `spectrum_form.py` - plots graphic with ocean typical ocean wave
  spectrum and its spatio-temporal representation.
- `spectrum_estimation.py` - plots graphic with estimation of
  the bi-directional spectrum by sensor data.
- `wave_animation.py` - animation of the slice of ocean waves
